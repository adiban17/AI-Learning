Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[34][35]

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37]

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Its implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[45] (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]

The name Python is said to come from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.[48]

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[49] Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[50][51] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[52][53] While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. "2.7.18+" (plus 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) "backported security updates".[54]

Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, with some new semantics and changed syntax. At least every Python release since (now unsupported) 3.5 has added some syntax to the language, and a few later releases have dropped outdated modules, or changed semantics, at least in a minor way.

Since 7 October 2024, Python 3.13 is the latest stable release, and it and, for few more months, 3.12 are the only releases with active support including for bug fixes (as opposed to just for security) and Python 3.9,[55] is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.8 reaching end-of-life.[56][57] Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half), followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).

Security updates were expedited in 2021 (and again twice in 2022, and more fixed in 2023 and in September 2024 for Python 3.12.6 down to 3.8.20), since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[58]) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[59] and web-cache poisoning.[60]

Python 3.10 added the | union type operator[61] and the match and case keywords (for structural pattern matching statements). 3.11 expanded exception handling functionality. Python 3.12 added the new keyword type. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[62] Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages (again improved in 3.14), and many other changes.

Python 3.13 introduces more syntax for types, a new and improved interactive interpreter (REPL), featuring multi-line editing and color support; an incremental garbage collector (producing shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects, and addition to the improved speed in 3.11 and 3.12), and an experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler (such features, can/needs to be enabled specifically for the increase in speed),[63] and an experimental free-threaded build mode, which disables the global interpreter lock (GIL), allowing threads to run more concurrently, that latter feature enabled with python3.13t or python3.13t.exe.

Python 3.13 introduces some change in behavior, i.e. new "well-defined semantics", fixing bugs (plus many removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods, and removed some of the C API and outdated modules): "The [old] implementation of locals() and frame.f_locals is slow, inconsistent and buggy [and it] has many corner cases and oddities. Code that works around those may need to be changed. Code that uses locals() for simple templating, or print debugging, will continue to work correctly."[64]

Some (more) standard library modules and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, will be removed in Python 3.15 or 3.16.[65][66]

Python 3.11 adds Sigstore digital verification signatures for all CPython artifacts (in addition to PGP). Since use of PGP has been criticized by security practitioners Python is moving to Sigstore exclusively and dropping PGP from 3.14.[67]

Python 3.14 is now in alpha 3; regarding possible change to annotations: "In Python 3.14, from __future__ import annotations will continue to work as it did before, converting annotations into strings."[68]

PEP 711 proposes PyBI: a standard format for distributing Python Binaries.[69]

Python 3.15 will "Make UTF-8 mode default",[70] the mode exists in all current Python versions, but currently needs to be opted into. UTF-8 is already used, by default, on Windows (and elsewhere), for most things, but e.g. to open files it's not and enabling also makes code fully cross-platform, i.e. use UTF-8 for everything on all platforms.
